# Challenge 

## Concerns for the insurance company

A fire can spread to all other structures of a farm (barn, granaries, silos, etc.): 

- We expect that a farm with more structures will be more at risk of fire propagation than a smaller one;
- If all structures on a farm are close to each other, the fire risk will be larger.

How to model the risk of fire contagion?

# Google Earth 

.pull-left[

- We identified the physical disposition of farms using the address of the farm
and images from *Google Earth*;  

- Images allowed us to find the size of each structure of the farm, and the distance between all structures;  

- Based on these distances between structures on the same farm, we then propose a new pricing approach that considers fire propagation.

# Risk of Fire

## Fire Origin 

To model the risk of fire of a stucture, two possibilities must be studied:

1)  The fire starts directly from that structure; 

2)  The fire starts in another structure but *somehow* propagates to that structure. 

## Contagion Processes

There are many ways the fire starting in structure $b$ can spread to structure $a$:

- *Level 1 contagion*, where the fire spread directly from structure $b$ to structure $a$;  

- *Level 2 contagion*, where the fire spread first from structure $b$ to another structure, and from that structure spread to structure $a$;  

- Any other levels of contagions, where, more generally, for a farm with $J$ structures, there are potentially up to
	$J - 1$ levels of contagion, where each successive level of contagion has longer and longer paths from structure
	b to structure a.

If we want to rate structure $a$, 2 contagions have to be considered:

1) A fire that starts in structure $b$: 
  - **A level 1 contagion, where the fire passes directly from $b$ to $a$**; 
  
  - A level 2 contagion, where the fire passes from $b$ to $c$, and then goes from $c$ to $a$.  

2) A fire that starts in structure $c$: 
  - A level 1 contagion, where the fire passes directly from $c$ to $a$;

# Contagion Processes

- Each contagion process is an exponential random variables noted $\epsilon (\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ depends on the distance between structures. 

- A structure will catch fire when $\epsilon$ will be less than a certain threshold $\phi$. The probability of a specific type of contagion is then expressed as:

$$\Pr(I = 1) = \Pr(\epsilon(\lambda) \le \phi = 1)  = 1 - \exp(-\lambda)$$  

- For a level 1 contagion, we could use $\lambda = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 d_1)$, where $d_1$ is the distance between the structure studied and the structure where the fire originated,

- For a level 2 contagion, we could use $\lambda = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 d_1 + \beta_2 d_2)$, where:
  - $d_1$ is the distance between the intermediate structure and the structure where the fire originated; 
  - $d_2$ is the distance between the intermediate structure and the structure studied.

- etc.

---

# Impact of Parameters

The figure illustrates the probability of contagion for a level 1 contagion, depending on the distance $d_1$, for various values of $\beta_1$.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Beta1.png")
```

---

# Competition between Processes

- Each potential path of a fire is a contagion process and among all contagion processes, at most one fire contagion is realized. 

- This can be seen as a competition between all contagion processes to determine which one will be the cause of the fire reaching a structure. 

> Therefore, the contagion process that is realized can be considered the minimum value of all processes
 involved. Because each process is an exponential random variable, it can be shown that the minimum value of all processes is an exponential variable with parameter equal to the sum of all parameters.

# Premium from Fire Contagion

In summary, to price the structure $a$, we obtain the following two probabilities of contagion, based on the fire origin (in subscript):

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pr(I^{(a)}_{b} = 1) = F_{\epsilon^{(a)}_{b}}(1; \lambda^{(a)}_{b}) = 1 -\exp(- \lambda^{(a)}_{b}) \\
\Pr(I^{(a)}_{c} = 1) = F_{\epsilon^{(a)}_{c}}(1; \lambda^{(a)}_{c}) = 1 -\exp(- \lambda^{(a)}_{c}) 
\end{eqnarray*}

# Inference: Example

.pull-left[

A fire on a farm implies 2 types of contagion processes:

1- Observed processes in competition;  
2- Unobserved processes that not *activated*.

### Example

Suppose a farm with 4 structures with:

i) The origin of the fire is structure $b$;  

ii) Structures $a$ and $c$ are affected by the fire (we don't know in what order);  

iii) Structure $d$ is spared and is not affected by the fire.

We want to analyse what happened to structure $a$ from the contagion processes.

# Loglikelihood

With our sample of 39 fires, we found $25,907$ contagion processes for contagion levels 1,2 and 3:
	
- $25,618$ processes are considered impossible:  
		
$$\ell_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{25,618} - \lambda_i$$

- For the remaining $289$ possible processes, we obtained $37$ competitions between processes:
	
$$\ell_2 = \sum_{i=1}^{37} \log(1 - \exp(-\lambda_i))$$
where $\lambda_i$ corresponds to the sum of $\lambda$ from possible processes. 

To estimate the parameters of the model, we then obtain the total log-likelihood of $\ell = \ell_1 + \ell_2$.

# Premium

The premium for structure $a$ is then computed as:
	
\begin{eqnarray*}
		\pi^{(a)} = E[S^{(a)}] &=& E[N_a] E[Y^{(a)}]  + \alpha \sum_{k=1, k\ne a}^J E[N_k] E[I^{(a)}_{k}] E[Y^{(a)}] 
\end{eqnarray*}

where: 

1) $I^{(a)}_{k}$ is an indicator that a fire that starts in structure $k$ touches structure $a$;

2) $N_k$, the number of fires starting in structure $k$ (per year), a function of the area of the structure, with: 
$$E[N_k] = \text{area of the structure in }m^2/500000.$$

3) $Y^{(a)}$, the severity of a fire in structure $a$ is a function of the area of the structure, with: 

$$E[Y^{(a)}] = 5000 \times \sqrt{\text{area of the structure in }m^2}$$

4) If the fire comes from a contagion, we assume that the damage will be $0.25 \times Y^{(a)}$.

# Conclusion

- The approach can be seen as a first step in modeling fire contagion between structures - in this case, in farm insurance;  
- Improvements are proposed in the paper to generalize the proposed model;
- Application with larger datasets could be interesting:
  - To check some of the hypothesis;
  - To verify if the sample used in this project is representative;
  - To consider all type of fire;
  - etc.
- Using the fire contagion model for home insurance is also a possibility:
